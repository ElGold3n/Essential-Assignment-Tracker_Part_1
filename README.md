This is a simple, personal Essential Assignment Tracker I built to help me stay organized during my university stint.

What it does:

Shows upcoming Assignments and deadlines on the Home page
Lets you quickly add new assignments or study sessions
Uses colored badges to highlight what’s urgent (Due Soon / Overdue)
Keeps everything lightweight — no login, no ads, just your clear-cut Assignments.
Main goal:

Help you to see at a glance what needs attention today or this week, so you don’t miss deadlines and can make better plans.

Allows you to back up and export your data to a JSON file for offline use or continuing on another device if your computer breaks.
Built with:

HTML + CSS for layout and style
A dash of JavaScript for adding Assignments dynamically
Inspired by my own handwritten Assignment notes and sketches
